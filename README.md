AI Assignment

The notebook is trying to analyze patterns within a dataset that contains information about credit card fraud. What are key indicators of fraud?

Reflection
a. What concrete benefits did you see by utilizing AI to help you make the notebook?

b. What dangers do you see for someone using AI to make this notebook without learning data science properly? Give concrete examples.

c. Give examples where you needed to verify the AI output for correctness. How did you know to verify those outputs?

Using AI made the coding portion of the notebook a lot faster. When you have an idea in mind, but don't know how to immediately put it into code, AI does it really well. Doing data vizualization can be tedious and repetitive. There are many times during the assignment where I saw repeated lines over and over. AI can immediately type out all the stylization of creating a graph in seconds, while it may take someone like me a minute+ to create a single graph. The danger of using AI without a core foundation is not knowing what prompts to give AI. While AI can bring one's ideas to life, the idea has to be good in the first place. Having solid fundamentals in data science leads to a well organized project. Your initial analysis of a datset come into play when creating prompts between key variables instead of a bunch of random useless variables that have nothing to do with eachother. 
When verifying the output of AI, I just looked at the notebook example you gave us. Some of the graphs had slight changes to them, but overall it went well. I noticed AI used old outdated code snippets that popped up as warnings in jupyter notebook. Another key observation is AI's lack of labeling. All the variables had generic names that had nothing to do with the dataset or content stored inside.
